		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>The webpages contain unique visualization dashboard for the research data at Center for Employee Health Studies (CEHS) located at UIC. This data includes workers’ compensation claims from a Third Party Administrator (TPA) for self-insured companies. Specifically, researchers are looking at the costs of workers’ compensation claims for Illinois and 6 other Midwestern states, and stratifying by whether the workers’ compensation claim was litigated and which body part was injured. This will help them to understand the cost differentials between Illinois and the other states, as well as by injury type within Illinois. Costs being considered include lost work time, medical costs, and administrative/legal costs.</p>
